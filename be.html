    <h2>B E/B.TECH </h2>
    <p>Engineering is one of the most popular degree courses after 12th Science. Dealing with the different principles and theoretical concepts, the program is offered in the form of a Bachelor of Engineering [BE] or Bachelor of Technology [BTech]. While the former focuses more on building a theoretical foundation, the latter is more application-centric. All these aspects are covered in both B.E. and BTech. However, this raises a common question every engineering aspirant has in their mind, i.e. “What is the difference between BE and BTech?” This is one of the crucial aspects of choosing the right course and you need all the information to make the smart choice.</p>
    <p><strong>BE</strong> stands for Bachelor of Engineering, while <strong>B.Tech</strong> stands for Bachelor of Technology. Both BE and B.Tech are undergraduate academic degrees awarded in the field of engineering and technology. The specific title may vary depending on the educational institution and country.</p>  
    <p>These degrees typically have a duration of four years and are designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of various engineering principles, theories, and practical applications. The programs cover a wide range of disciplines, including civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science and engineering, chemical engineering, and many others.</p>
