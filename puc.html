    <h2><u>PUC:</u></h2>
    <p>PUC stands for Pre-University Course. It is an intermediate level of education in India, typically taken after the completion of 10 years of schooling (SSLC/10th grade) and before pursuing undergraduate studies. PUC is also known as 10+2 or HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate) in different regions of India.</p>
    <p>PUC is a two-year program that prepares students for higher education, including undergraduate programs in various fields. It is offered by junior colleges or pre-university colleges affiliated with state education boards or central boards like CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) or CISCE (Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations).</p>
    <p>During PUC, students can choose from different streams or subject combinations based on their interests and future career aspirations. The common streams include Science (PCMB/PCMC), Commerce (CEBA), and Arts/Humanities. Each stream has a specific set of subjects, and students typically select subjects related to their desired field of study in the future.</p>
